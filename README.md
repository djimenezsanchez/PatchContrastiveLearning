# Patch Contrastive Learning (PCL)
Self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning has seen great success in image recognition, especially when labeled examples are scarce, which is the usual case with medical image data. Following this paradigm, we proposed PCL, a self-supervised learning that inputs image crops and outputs enriched feature vectors.
